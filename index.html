    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>

    <h2>Campus Leadership & Involvement</h2>

    <h3>Campus Ambassador</h3>
    <p>
        As a Campus Ambassador at Mount St. Joseph University, I give campus tours 
        and assist with events for high school students who are interested in attending MSJ. 
        This role has strengthened my public speaking and leadership skills.
    </p>

    <h3>Vice President – Performing Arts Leadership Council (PALC)</h3>
    <p>
        I serve as the Vice President of PALC, a student organization that bridges 
        the gap between the performing arts and the rest of campus. We organize events 
        such as Open Mic Night and the Performing Arts Gala to bring students together 
        through creative expression.

    <h3>Mount St. Joseph Wrestling Team</h3>
    <p>
        I am a member of the Mount St. Joseph University Wrestling Team, competing 
        in the 285 lb weight class. Wrestling has helped me develop discipline, 
        resilience, and teamwork.
