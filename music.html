    <h3>Concert Band</h3>
    <p>
        I participated in Concert Band for all four years of high school, 
        performing on Bass Clarinet. This experience helped build my 
        foundational musicianship and ensemble skills.

        I was a member of the Marching Band during my junior and senior years, 
        performing on Tenor Saxophone and developing performance stamina and precision.
